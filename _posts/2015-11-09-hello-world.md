Hi! I am <a href="http://gaius.coffee">GaiusCoffee</a>, Administrator of ISO-8.

This site is intended to be a resource website for Netmarble Games' Marvel Future Fight (MFF). This site will also be my blog where articles related to the game will be posted at least twice every month. You can expect the following from the ISO-8 site:

* :rocket: A Marvel Future Fight <a href="{{ '/teambuilder' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Team Builder</a>, with up-to-date character data, such as statistics, skills, gears, strikers & team bonuses.
* :rocket: Character Reviews, starting with Wasp later this week. (Disclaimer: Wasp is my favorite character. If you guys want to contribute, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/GaiusCoffee/iso-8/issues">contact me</a>).
* :rocket: News regarding events, including guides, tips & tricks. Don't worry- speculation will be clearly marked.
* :rocket: Much, much more :P

I hope you enjoy visiting and reading ISO-8, as well as the (currently under construction) Team Builder. If you find any bugs or errors, or if you have suggestions, contributions or criticisms, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/GaiusCoffee/iso-8/issues">contact me</a>.

Until next time.
